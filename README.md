# cc-life-expectancy-gdp
 Codecademy Life Expectancy and GDP data analysis project

## Project instructions

For this project, you will analyze data on GDP and life expectancy from the World Health Organization and the World Bank to try and identify the relationship between the GDP and life expectancy of six countries.

During this project, you will analyze, prepare, and plot data in order to answer questions in a meaningful way.

After you perform your analysis, youâ€™ll be creating a blog post to share your findings on the World Health Organization website.

### Project Objectives:
- Complete a project to add to your portfolio
- Use seaborn and Matplotlib to create visualizations
- Become familiar with presenting and sharing data visualizations
- Preprocess, explore, and analyze data

### Prerequisites:
- Data Acquisition
- Data Visualization
- Hypothesis Testing
- Summarizing Quantitative Data
- Data Wrangling and Tidying
- Data Manipulation with Pandas

### Project Requirements
Your blog post should include the following:
- A compelling title about your findings
- An introduction to the data research
- A section sharing the background info (definition of GDP for example) and sources for your data as well as any further research you conducted
- An accompanying paragraph describing the following visualizations
- A conclusion touching on the limitations of the data and further research

Visualizations that can be included:
- The violin plot of the life expectancy distribution by country
- The facet grid of scatter graphs mapping GDP as a function of Life Expectancy by country
- The facet grid of line graphs mapping GDP by country
- The facet grid of line graphs mapping Life Expectancy by country

## Project tasks
1. Setting up the project
